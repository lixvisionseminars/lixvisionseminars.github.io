  abstract: "Traditional approaches to 4D scene reconstruction often rely on computationally heavy iterative optimization or fragmented pipelines, piecing together separate models for depth, motion, and camera estimation. In this talk, we introduce D4RT (Dynamic 4D Reconstruction and Tracking), a powerful feedforward model that unifies these tasks into a single, scalable architecture. We will explore D4RT’s core innovation: a lightweight decoding mechanism paired with a robust video encoder, allowing it to independently query the 3D position of any pixel across space and time. We will also discuss the key design choices that enable D4RT to achieve state-of-the-art performance across reconstruction, tracking, and camera benchmarks. Finally, we will showcase its capabilities through qualitative results and baseline comparisons, before concluding with a discussion of current limitations and future directions."
